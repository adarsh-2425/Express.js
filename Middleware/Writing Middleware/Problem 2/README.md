# Problem: 
You want to modify the request or response objects in a middleware function, but you're not sure if it will affect other middleware functions 
or route handlers in the chain.

## Solution: 
In Express.js, you can modify the request or response objects in a middleware function without affecting other middleware functions 
or route handlers in the chain, 
as long as you call the next() function to pass control to the next middleware function or route handler in the chain.
