# E-Commerce website
You are building an e-commerce website that has different routes for customers and administrators. Customers can view products, add items to their cart, 
and place orders, while administrators can view and manage products, orders, and customers.
You want to implement authentication middleware that ensures that only authenticated users can access the administrator routes.
